## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](/Project-Screenshot.png)

Hello there!

Here is my first project. I did not want to dive in a tutorial hell so I started to build my own projects and here is the first one.

It is just a simple countdown as you could easily understand from the its name.

I will add some futures in the future, If I did not make any similar projects.

Thank you for visiting my first project. I hope that it will be the first documentation for me to become a web developer.
